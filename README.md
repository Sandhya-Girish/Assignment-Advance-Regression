## General Information
Problem Description:-
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing decided to enter Australian market and wants to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price.The company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia

Requirement :-
The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. Hence, there is a need to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not

Objective :-
The company wants to create a model that will be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns.

The dataset used for the project is train.csv

## Conclusions
- There are outliers found in the dataset which needed the outlier treatment to get the good accuracy for Ridge & Lasso regression models
- After model builiding, it is observed that Lasso regression model is slightly better than Ridge regression model & can be used for further analysis & predictions
- Top 5 fields which contribute to the selling of the houses are 'MSSubClass', 'LotArea', 'Street', 'OverallQual', 'OverallCond'

## Technologies Used
- library - version 3.0
